## Overview
In this exercise, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image. In the second part, you will use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

*Note: Additional optional assignments included. See [pdf](https://github.com/chivingtoninc/Coursera-Machine-Learning/blob/master/machine-learning-ex7/ex7.pdf)*
